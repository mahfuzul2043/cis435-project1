        <p>
          My name is Mahfuzul Haque. I'm currently a senior at the Univeristy of Michigan - Dearborn campus. Currently,
          I'm pursuing a bachelor's degree
          in software engineering and hope to pursue a master's in the same major right after I graduate. I live in a
          small city next to Detroit called
          Hamtramck.
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of employment, I'm currently working in a company called Darena Solutions as a software developer. I
          previously worked in a company
          called Nemo Capital Partners (now Nemo Health) as a software developer/IT intern. Unrelated to my field, I
          worked as an electronics sales
          associate in Target and a valet attendant at All Time Parking.

          </p>
          <p>
            Brothers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan wrote the screenplay, which had its origins in a script Jonathan
            developed in 2007. Christopher co-produced Interstellar with his wife, Emma Thomas, through their production
            company Syncopy, and with Lynda Obst through Lynda Obst Productions. Caltech theoretical physicist Kip

            Interstellar.
            Paramount Pictures, Warner Bros., and Legendary Pictures co-financed the film. Cinematographer Hoyte van
            Hoytema

            place
            in
            Alberta (Canada), Iceland and Los Angeles. Interstellar uses extensive practical and miniature effects and
            the
            company Double Negative created additional digital effects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Interstellar premiered on October 26, 2014, in Los Angeles, California. In the United States, it was first
            released on film stock, expanding to venues using digital projectors. The film had a worldwide gross of over
            $677 million, making it the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2014. Interstellar received critical praise for
            its
            themes, visual effects, musical score, and acting. At the 87th Academy Awards, the film won the Academy
            Award
            for Best Visual Effects, and was nominated for Best Original Score, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing
            and

            <span class='bold'>3. Batman: The Dark Knight</span>
          </a>
          <p>
            The Dark Knight is a 2008 superhero film directed, co-produced, and co-written by Christopher Nolan. Based
            on
            the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the second installment of Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy and a
            sequel to 2005's Batman Begins, starring Christian Bale and supported by Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Gary
            Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Morgan Freeman. In the film, Bruce Wayne / Batman (Bale),
            Police
            Lieutenant James Gordon (Oldman) and District Attorney Harvey Dent (Eckhart) form an alliance to dismantle
            organized crime in Gotham City, but are menaced by an anarchistic mastermind known as the Joker (Ledger),
            who
            seeks to undermine Batman's influence and turn the city to chaos.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nolan's inspiration for the film was the Joker's comic book debut in 1940, the 1988 graphic novel The
            Killing
            Joke, and the 1996 series The Long Halloween, which retold Harvey Dent's origin. The "Dark Knight" nickname
            was
            first applied to Batman in Batman #1 (1940), in a story written by Bill Finger.[4][5] The Dark Knight was
            filmed
            primarily in Chicago, as well as in several other locations in the United States, the United Kingdom, and
            Hong
            Kong. Nolan used IMAX 70 mm film cameras to film some sequences, including the Joker's first appearance in
            the
            film. Warner Bros. initially created a viral marketing campaign for The Dark Knight, developing promotional
            websites and trailers highlighting screenshots of Ledger as the Joker. Ledger died on January 22, 2008, some
            months after he completed filming and six months before the film's release from a toxic combination of
            prescription drugs, leading to intense attention from the press and movie-going public.
          </p>
          <p>
            A co-production of the United States and the United Kingdom, The Dark Knight was released on July 18, 2008
            in
            the United States and on July 25, 2008 in the United Kingdom. Film critics considered it one of the best
            films
            of its decade and one of the best superhero films of all time;[6][7] the film received highly positive
            reviews,
            particularly for its action, score, screenplay, performances (particularly Ledger's), visual effects, and
            direction, setting numerous records during its theatrical run.[8] The Dark Knight appeared on 287 critics'
            top
            ten lists, more than any other film of 2008 with the exception of WALL-E, and more critics (77) named The
            Dark
            Knight the best film released that year.[9] With over $1 billion in revenue worldwide, it became the
            highest-grossing film of 2008 and is the 43rd highest-grossing film of all time, unadjusted for inflation
            (4th
            at the time of release); it also set the record for highest-grossing domestic opening with $158 million, a
            record it held for three years.[10] The film received eight Academy Award nominations; it won the award for
            Best
            Sound Editing and Ledger was posthumously awarded Best Supporting Actor.[11] In 2016 it was voted 33rd among
            100
            films considered the best of the 21st century by 117 film critics from around the world.[12] The Dark Knight
            Rises, the final film in the trilogy, was released on July 20, 2012.
